## Overview
In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. With the help of command line parameters you can enter various parameter for yor model and make predictions.

## Part 1 - Jupyter Notebook Implementation
The project is broken down into multiple steps:
- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content

## Part 2 - Command Line Application
Now that you've built and trained a deep neural network on the flower data set, it's time to convert it into an application that others can use. Your application should be a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line. For testing, you should use the checkpoint you saved in the first part.

## Train
The first file, `train.py`, will train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint.

## Predict
The second file, `predict.py`, uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image.

## Specifications
The project submission must include at least two files `train.py` and `predict.py`. Make sure to include all files necessary to run `train.py` and `predict.py` in your submission.
